# Jerky

## Types of cuts

### Beef

You want as lean of a cut as possible (very little fat). When dried, the fat tends to get very sticky and keeps a little too much moisture in.

Round cuts are usually pretty safe bets, like bottom round, eye of round, or london broil. There's very little fat, and often times you can find them cut pretty thin by the butcher, which makes it much easier to cut into strips. But any lean cut will work.

## Cutting your jerky strips

If the meat that you buy is thick, and you need to cut them vertically to get thin strips, a simple trick to make this *much* easier is to stick them in the freezer for 20-40 min. Not long enough to thoroughly freeze them, but enough to get them close. It'll firm up the meat, and make it much easier to cut them thinner without the meat deforming or you cutting yourself. If you're cutting a lot of meat, take them out one at a time, since they warm up very quickly.

Whatever you get, you want to cut them into thin strips, preferably around 0.25 inches thick. Width/length is a personal choice. I usually cut them thin and short (about 0.5-1" wide, and 2-4" long), but I've had some pretty good jerky that was cut in big 4" squares. I would recommend cutting against the grain, or on a diagonal. Cutting with the grain tends to make the dried jerky a little harder to eat, as it pulls off into long strings and makes things a little chewier/tougher.


## Marinating

You should marinate your cut strips of meat for at least 12 hours, preferably 24-48. The longer the better, unless the meat starts to go bad. Usually I leave it for 1-2 nights. You'll have very little flavor if it's not left long enough.


## Drying

- Feed dehydrator
  - Usually 4-6 hours is enough
- Oven
  - Keep it as low heat as possible. Convection prefered. Put something under to catch marinade drips.
- [Box fan method](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/beef-jerky-recipe.html)
  - Never tried it. Supposedly it works.

 The thicker the meat, the more time it takes. It's best to cut your meat as uniformly as possible. Otherwise, take out the thinner pieces first. You can check periodically ("testing" them of course!). You want them slightly dryer than you might think. Once you take them out, put them in a ziplock bag, or airtight container for a few hours, preferably overnight. This will allow them to even out the moisture content from the relatively moist inside, to the dry outside. If you find they are too dry in the morning, add a small amount of water (1 tsp or so) and let them sit a little longer. The meat will absorb the water and moisten up.
