### Types of cuts

You want as lean of a cut as possible (very little fat). When dried, the fat tends to get very sticky and keeps a little too much moisture in.

Whatever you get, you want to cut them into thin strips, preferably around 0.25 inches thick. Width/length is a personal choice. I usually cut them thin and short (about 0.5-1" wide, and 2-4" long), but I've had some pretty good jerky that was cut in big 4" squares. I would recommend cutting against the grain, or on a diagonal. Cutting with the grain tends to make the dried jerky a little harder to eat, as it pulls off into long strings and makes things a little chewier/tougher.

Round cuts are usually pretty safe bets, like bottom round, eye of round, or london broil. There's very little fat, and often times you can find them cut pretty thin by the butcher, which makes it much easier to cut into strips. But any lean cut will work.

If the meat that you buy is thick, and you need to cut them vertically to get thin strips, a simple trick to make this *much* easier is to stick them in the freezer for 20-40 min. Not long enough to thoroughly freeze them, but enough to get them close. It'll firm up the meat, and make it much easier to cut them thinner without the meat deforming or you cutting yourself. If you're cutting a lot of meat, take them out one at a time, since they warm up very quickly.
