# Sriracha BBQ Beef Jerky

## Marinade

amount | ingredient
---: | ---
1-2 cup | brown sugar (start with 1 cup, add more if it's too watery)
4 tbsp | Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Sauce (adjusted to your liking)
8 tbsp | worcestershire sauce
3 tbsp | soy sauce
1 "squeeze" | lemon juice (or 1 tsp of crystalized lemon)
4-6 tbsp | salt (adjust to taste)
1 tbsp | honey
2 tbsp | bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's suggested)
0.5 tbsp | liquid smoke
 | black pepper
 | chili powder (or extra sriracha)
 | onion powder
 | garlic powder
 | ground mustard
 | paprika

Combine all ingredients in mixing bowl, and stir until well mixed. It will settle, so make sure you stir it right before marinating.

### Barbeque sauce
You can use any sauce you like here, but I usually just use some Sweet Baby Ray's (Hickory). I know it's not "real" BBQ sauce (and chock full of sugar), but the flavor is relatively subtle here, and it's very thick which helps with this marinade.
